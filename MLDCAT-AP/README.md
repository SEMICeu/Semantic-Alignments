# MLDCAT-AP Semantic Mappings

This folder contains all the mappings created as outcome of the alignment process of MLDCAT-AP with other specifications such as ML Croissant (Schema.org).

Mappings are currently provided as a spreadsheet, so they can be consulted as a tabular format, and as RDF.

For more information on the process, please see the [README](../README.md)
